## Preparation for the workshop

To be able to focus on the important stuff, it is necessary that all participants do some preparation before the workshop. This includes downloading all the needed tools, setting them up etc. Here are the things you should do before you come to the workshop:

- Having attended the [introduction to docker of the previous meetup](https://github.com/western-greece-developers/meetup/blob/master/meetups/2/Docker%20101.pdf) or read the (TODO: Pending link to docker introduction)
- Laptop with wireless card (no access to cables can be guaranteed)
- SSH Client for your OS
- Installed and working on your laptop: git, docker, docker-compose (TODO: add more tools here)
- A text editor or an IDE installed on your laptop

Nice to have:

- Access to our Slack channel (Register here: https://wgsdg.herokuapp.com/)
  We might need to share links or other information during the workshop. It might be easier if everyone is on the same chat.
