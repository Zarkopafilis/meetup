# Meetup #3

When: 30th of September 2017, 11:00am
Where: Probably POS coworking space [TBD]
What: Workshop on containers, docker and container orchestration
Who: Organizers of the workshop: Spiros Oikonomakis, Marios Karagiannopoulos, Dimitris Karakasilis (TODO: Want to help? Contact one of the people on this list)

## Schedule

- Part 1 (11:00 - 13:00) :
  - Create a basic development environment for Rails
  - Add SQL database
  - Add Redis database
  - Add background workers

- Lunch break (13:00 - 14:00) (TODO: Arrange free lunch or come up with alternative)

- Part 2 (14:00 - 16:00):
  - Containerize your test suite
  - Automate it (let it run whenever a change is made)
  - Share your environment with the rest of your team (version your images)
  - Improvisation. Containerize your own application.

## Preparation for the workshop

To be able to focus on the important stuff, it is necessary that all participants do some preparation before the workshop. This includes downloading all the needed tools, setting them up etc. Here are the things you should do before you come to the workshop:

- Having attended the [introduction to docker of the previous meetup](https://github.com/western-greece-developers/meetup/blob/master/meetups/2/Docker%20101.pdf) or some other docker introduction.
- Laptop with wireless card (no access to cables can be guaranteed)
- SSH Client for your OS
- Installed and working on your laptop: git, docker, docker-compose
- A text editor or an IDE installed on your laptop

Nice to have:

- Access to our Slack channel (Register here: https://wgsdg.herokuapp.com/)
  We might need to share links or other information during the workshop. It might be easier if everyone is on the same chat.

## Results

Around 17 people attended the workshop. We managed to mostly stick to the schedule, people managed to follow the guide (for the most part).

Improvements for the future:

- Keep the irrelevant stuff simpler (too much Rails)
- Create a VM that people can use and share it before the workshop.
- Better support different OS' (e.g. Windows, Mac)
- Arrange for food.
