## Results

- Discussed about future presentations on Containers/Docker and also the possibility
  of workshops. We agreed it would be a good idea. One of the interesting matters
  is containers in production environments.

- Discussed the possibility of a future presentation on Remote working but
  this time in the context of job hunting, or "how to find a remote job", with
  resources, links, tips etc.

- Decided to do the next meetup some time around the start of September or end of August (to be decided)
