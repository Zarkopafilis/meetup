# Meetup #1

Event link: https://www.meetup.com/Western-Greece-Software-Development-Meetup/events/240584653/

## Agenda

The following are topics that will be discussed and some proposals

### Introduction

Present ourselves. Whoever wants can present themselves in anyway they like
(interests, expectations, where they come from, interest in organizing a next
meetup etc). Something like 3 minutes per person should be enough.

### Location

- Remote attending (streaming etc)

- Standard (always the same)
  - Can't be called "western greece" any more. Doesn't solve the inital problem.

- Criteria for selection
  - At least 2 presentations (maybe a minimum number of votes for each if voting takes place?)
  - A venue to host the event
  - On person attending taking responsibility (booking venue  etc)
  - Minimum requirements (e.g. projector, free wifi)?

### Frequency

- Standard (e.g. every 2 months)
- Whenever a place gets 2 presentations for a specific date and at least N
  number of days have passed since the last meetup.
  (first to reach, organizes the event). We will need to create a tool for this.
  (maybe create one in a workshop?)

### Duration (max presentations)

Up to:

- Full day (with lunch break)
  Can't do this all the time but makes sense to travel for a full day of (quality)
  presentations and workshops
- Half day (we can eat at home) ~ 4-5 hours
  Still enough value to travel some kilometers and easier for people to attend
  the whole event.
- 1-2 hours max
  Many people might not travel 2 hours to attend a 2 hour event.

### Topics

- Come what may (from IoT to Drupal development, bring it on).
- Related to programming only (no descriptive languages, CMS', system administration etc).
- Vote for presentations (Some topics/languages might always win).
- Workshops (in sequels?)

### Organizational tools

- Git repository
- Meetup.com
- Mailing list? Google group?

## Presentations

No presentations for this first meetup


## Results / Notes

- Decided to do this monthly (or as soon as we get 2 presentations for the same place)
- We will consider a place according to the above rules (See [Location](#location) section)
- Topics will be requested through GitHub and all collaboration should take place
  there (through PRs and issues).
- A Slack channel will be created for real time communication.
- We will investigate our options for streaming the events.
- Next meetup should take place sometime in July.
- Next meetup should include presentations but can also include a round table conversation about
  business matters (startups, problems of companies in Greece, etc).

### Topics Brainstorming

- How to destroy a startup (Pantelis)
- Software product management (Pantelis)
- Medical IT (Pantelis)

TODO

- Slack channel
- Open issues for presentation ideas
- Find venue for next meetup (if not at the same place)
